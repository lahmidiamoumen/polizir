'),o("br"),e._v(" We must also realize how useful it is to devote some of our free time to politics. It is urgent to work on new ideas that are more consistent with the objectives we propose to achieve and also with the century in which we live... "),o("br"),e._v(" Over and over again we have come across the result of deregulated capitalism; increasing inequalities and usurpation of natural resources by some in the name of profit. Communism has also demonstrated over and over again in several countries and contexts that it is important that society somehow premeie effort and not benefit in the same way those who make sacrifices and those who do not increase the risk of impoverishment! Does it still make sense to think of left and right as it was done in the 17th century? Or is it time to overcome this paradigm and understand that we all have the right to have different beliefs and different life experiences, that it makes no sense to fit into labels? Who is it, and what is the state anyway? What are taxes for and how should they be applied? The state is the set of institutions that belong to all of us, and therefore to no one... Anyone can enter public office at any time. "),o("br"),e._v(" In the same way those who perform functions may also be asked to leave. Nothing is immutable. The only and main functions of the state should be the promotion of equal opportunity in access to community resources, through the tended free practice of teaching, medical treatment in the defense of health and access to courts and true justice. Community resources are understood as the accumulated knowledge of the ancient generations, the possibility of mobility throughout the public space and the equitable use of all the raw materials, forests and rivers existing in the national territory, the biodiversity of the species, a clean atmosphere, cyberspace, in short and what common sense tells us, Community resources are all physical and non-physical goods that belong to all and which should never be subject to the control of a single individual or group. The state must thus promote equal access to all these resources, and then it is up to the individual to work on them or not. The state is forests and rivers. The state is the quality of the air we all breathe. It is the accumulated knowledge of our ancestors that must be preserved and passed on to the following generations. It's the roads and the hospitals. The planet earth in its natural state without human intervention, is itself the greatest wealth that human beings possess. It is from him, of his nature, that all the food that enables our subsistence, the materials with which we build our dwellings, to him we are intimately linked to the smallest level of our own molecular constitution. It is nothing new to anyone that in the last century there has been a careless usurpation of their resources and that it should be our priority to recover them. Political stability is a basic requirement for any social progress to be achieved. The war between members of a community has never brought real benefit to no one, not even those who won it, and even among members of two different communities, although in the short term from an economic point of view it might seem to benefit the winning community, would it not be better in every way if there was help in every way? It is also increasingly obvious and urgent to make politics transparent. The citizen has every right to know to the smallest detail and at any time where the taxes he pays with the sweat of his work go. Of course this goes against the will of many of the so-called \"installed powers\". It is not in the interests of large multinationals or the most influential politicians to make democracy transparent. It is a path that still needs to be followed and presupposes a great union among the majority of the population. What is true politics? It is knowing how to share the resources that belong to all of us and therefore to any individual in particular. It is to bring solidarity to those who do not have support. It's having a project that involves the whole country. It's bringing hope to those who lost it. It's taking food where hunger is. It's something beautiful, honorable and pleasurable. It's doing good for the benefit of others. It's bringing the people together and not separating them. It's lifting who fell. It's giving a hand. Deep down? The real policy is to join forces in solidarity in building a richer and fairer society. And that's very easy.
